1. List out the Vue components required, and their specification.
```
    Todo
        - Props: project[String]
        - Events emitted: addTodo, removeTodo
        - State: todoItem[String], categories[Object], 
        - computed: selectedProject[Array]
    Home
        - State: message[String]

```

2. Suggest the format of the JSON object that specifies the application state in each design
```
    intial state
    {
        todoItem: '',
        categories: {
            family: ['wash clothes','buy milk','sweep floor'],
            school: ['do homework','read books'],
            exercise: ['lift weights','drink protein shake']
        },
        selectedProject[: []
    }

    routechange/project selected state //selected family
    {
